# Analysis of the "Entities" Column

To analyze the "entities" column in the provided CSV data, we focused on extracting meaningful insights from the structured information available. The "entities" column contains JSON-like structures with two main keys: **persons** and **organizations**, which list named entities (people, organizations, etc.) identified in the corresponding tweet or post.

## Steps for Analysis:
1. **Extract Entities**: Parse the entities column to extract all unique persons and organizations.
2. **Frequency Count**: Count how often each entity appears across the dataset.
3. **Categorize Entities**: Group entities by type (persons vs. organizations) and identify any patterns or trends.
4. **Contextual Insights**: Examine co-occurrence of entities with specific keywords like *LongCovid*, *Covid*, etc., to understand their relevance in discussions.
